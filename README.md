# CUSTOM THEME

This custom theme is a way to start your own custom theme. 
You will want to learn how to use the variables of the CMS so that your
theme will actually show content from the editor and tools of the CMS.

In this theme, we have made a simple design using the needed variables
and codes you should use in your custom theme. You can not simply paste
in your html code from another source and have things work properly. You
will need to copy the html of your new theme into the files here to keep
the new theme working. We suggest you have a second tab and on each editor
save, check that the site is still working by refreshing the home page in
the other tab. If the site is broken, fix it be backing out the last change
and correcting the error. This will make your overall progress faster.

Layouts:
When you add a page to your website, you can assign that page a layout.
Home, Article and Open are three included in this theme. You can not choose
Default for a page, as this is the root pattern for all the other theme
layouts. Changing something in Default layout will affect all other layouts
that build upon it.

Partials:
Most of the page design is broken into smaller sections of code, called Partials.
Within these partial files you will find the html and in the tab at the top of
the editor window, the CSS for that partial will be in the next tab. This will
help you identify the code you want to target and the associated CSS classes for
that code.
